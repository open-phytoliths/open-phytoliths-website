As part of the first initiative of ICOPS, we will be running training in different aspects of open research practices. 

This has started with Github training and over the last few month we have run three sessions: Github basics, Collaboration with Github and Further uses of Github.

You can find the resources in [our Github repository here](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/ICOPS-training-2022) and we also have a YouTube channel that contains videos of these workshops. [Here is a link to our YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCukf5wnApLug8bIZMJAhxOw)
