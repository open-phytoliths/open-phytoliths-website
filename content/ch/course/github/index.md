## What you will learn

- GitHub Basics
- Collaboration with GitHub
- Further uses of GitHub 

## Program overview
GitHub is a tool that is used for research project management and history tracking of your work during projects. It can be used to store and collaborate during projects with data, code and documentation. It is also useful for making free websites. 

The first basic course will cover the basic web interface of GitHub and how to make repositories, add files and folders. It will also include some examples of uses of GitHub.  

The second course covers collaborative workflows using GitHub including forking, branches and pull requests.

The third course covers how to enable and edit GitHub pages (websites), how to link GitHub to long-term archiving repositories (Zenodo and Open Science Framework) and briefly goes over project management boards.

* Here is an example of a GitHub repository used for a phytolith project: https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIR-phytoliths
* And a website produced using GitHub: https://open-phytoliths.github.io/FAIR-phytoliths/
