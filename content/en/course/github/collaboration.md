{{< spoiler text="How is working in a fork different from working in a branch?" >}}
* A fork is a copy of a repository that is an entirely independent repo. There is no need for write access or intent to merge with the main.
* A branch points to a specific commit in your repo. Branches are temporary places to work through a featureor task and you need write access to the repository.
