### What are our clinic sessions?
Are you struggling to put open science into practice? Would you like 1 to 1 help?

We are offering personalised help sessions to assist phytolith researchers, and those in related fields, implement open science practices in their research projects.

We are offering help with lots of different open science practices:
- Open access/Open publishing
- Open repositories
- Open and FAIR data
- Collaborative tools
- And more!

### Book your session!
- When: every last Friday of the month at 09:00-11:00 or 16:00-18:00 Brussel time. Check out or schedule and sign up for a slot [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K3yjSGWpK5WoPIiCAUW9sLW_jIKjFvME7aHfMqNPB20/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

- How/what: this is envisioned as a practical session so feel free to bring your own work (e.g. dataset, manuscript) if you need assistance on specific issues of your projects or come along with a general question. You can ask for help with anything open science related.
