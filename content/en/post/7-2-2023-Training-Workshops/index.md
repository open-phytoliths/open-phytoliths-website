The International Committee of Open Phytolith Science (ICOPS) is organising a series of workshops in Open Research Skills open to everyone. We will use examples and case studies from plant-related palaeoscience fields (e.g., archaeobotany, palaeoecology) but most of the talks and exercises will be general and therefore useful for all researchers

**List of training workshops in Open Research Skills**
- 24th February 2023 - Open access publishing
- 24th March 2023 - Using repositories
- 21st April 2023 - GitHub basics
- 28th April 2023 - GitHub collaborative workflows

- 30th June 2023 - FAIR data

All workshops will be on a Friday at 14:00 to 16:00 GMT - see the dates above.

The workshops will be a combination of short talks, discussions and hand-on exercises. 
Please look at this document for more details of what will be included in each workshop: [Details of Open Research Training Workshops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhWKjbDcLaCtiSbBGuC2L0Wq-gJmaNhztisFgwUKhn8/edit?usp=sharing).

Shared documents and slides used in the training will be made available before each workshop. All resources used in the training, including videos of the workshops, will be made openly available through our website as self-study courses by the end of June 2023. 

All workshops will be in English but we have the ability to provide the course materials, and at some workshops, live translation in a few languages. Please indicate if you would require this on the sign up form.
