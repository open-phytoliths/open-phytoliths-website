On July 20th 2022, the International Committee on Open Phytolith Science participated in 
the graduation ceremony of cohort 5 of the Open Life Science (OLS-5) program [youtube 
link with the event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XMGsmekddM). 
Our project called the ‘International Committee on Open Phytolith Science: An Open 
Science Community Building and Training Initiative for the Phytolith Community’ aimed to
train ICOPS committee members in the use of GitHub and open science practices.

Within this program, we focused on the construction of an action plan, the generation of 
the online infrastructure, including a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-phytoliths) 
and the [Open Phytoliths Community website](open-phytoliths.netlify.app), as well as the 
use of different community building tools such as Open canvas and Roadmap for the 
training and inclusion of the different members of the phytolith community at a global level.

Within our committee, we held discussions on governance, as well as reflections on 
different aspects of open research. One of the most necessary tasks of this committee is 
to conduct surveys and meetings that allow us to know the local reality of researchers, as
well as what encourages them or not to work within the "open data" and more broadly the 
open research movement.

We want to thank the OLS-5 organizers and all those who participated in the cohort 5.
Special thanks to our mentors, Malvika Sharan and Gracielle Higino for their constant 
support and for sharing their ideas and experiences to develop our project.
During our training at OLS5 we developed our motto: 

To build a shared vision for the adoption and implementation of open science among phytolith researchers globally.
