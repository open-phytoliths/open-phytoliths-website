I graduated in Archaeology at the University of Bologna and, after a Master in Archaeological Science at the University of Milan, I obtained my PhD in Archaeobotany from the University of Cambridge. After my PhD I held several postdoctoral contracts, including a MSC cofund contract at Univeristat Pompeu Fabra. 

In 2014 I co-funded the research group Culture and Socio-Ecological Dynamics, recognised by the Catalan Agency for Management of University and Research Grants (AGAUR) as an excellence group. In 2017 I was awarded a Starting grant project from the ERC to work on the role of drought-tolerant crops on the long-term resilience and adaptation to drylands (RAINDROPS ERC-Stg-2017, 759800). 

I am currently Director of UPF's Center of Studies on Planetary Wellebing, member of the Institutional Committe for Ethical Review of Projects at Univeristat Pompeu Fabra (CIREP) and part of the Group of Experts on Climate Change (GEC) for the Barcelona City Council. I am also co-leading of the FAIR Phytoliths Project.
