Doris is a micropaleontologist who specialises in the study of pollens and phytoliths. She learned palynology at the French Institute in Pondicherry, India, and obtained her PhD at the University of Aix Marseille, France. She was a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany, where she worked on large databases of pollen and plant functional traits. She joined the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in 2003 where she took up a research position at CEREGE in Aix en Provence, France. Since then, she has been and still is involved in numerous projects aiming at documenting paleo-vegetation at early hominid sites in Africa. She is currently on temporary assignment to the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs and is the Head of the Ecology Department at the French Institute in Pondicherry. Doris is the President of the International Phytolith Society since 2021.
